# If you encounter any issues, please report them
# to discord support server or via pm.
# Bugs or issues are mostly fixed within hours.
#
#
# Here you can edit the whole GUI.
# You can set GUI titles, the size and
# item names, lores, materials and slots.
# Don't remove any values or keys.
#
# You also can add new items to your GUI.
# This can be done under gui.<GUI>.s.<YourItemName>
# The name needs to be unique in this section.
# Example:
#
# gui:
#   mainmenu:
#     p:
#       placeholder_1:
#       material: 'GRAY_STAINED_GLASS_PANE'
#       from: 1
#       to: 27
#
# Please note: You need to set all values
# otherwise BetterFarming will auto generate values.
# Also you can't set items where list items
# are configured. Means if for example the
# list in the BetterFarming GUI goes from slot
# 10 - 12 you can set any items with
# the slot 10, 11, 12. They will be ignored.
#
#
# If you encounter any issues or you simply have
# some questions, contact me via PM or Discord.
